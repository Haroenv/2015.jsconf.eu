PayPal and Braintree are changing the way that people do business, as well as the way that large scale applications are built:

From our open source KrakenJS application suite to our easy to use APIs, we are proud to be part of the JavaScript community and are committed to creating experiences that both customers and developers love. PayPal and Braintree are constructing new breeds of identity systems, API standards, and payment platforms to support the next generation of disruptive technology.
